            If someone is searching for example for a guitar to buy online, the
            google will first recommend websites that are most optimized in

            content and would be trusted by customers. <br />

            change of a user visiting our website.

            <br /> Search engines like Google use bots to crawl web pages and
            index their content. Then, they use algorithms to decide which pages
            best match a search query. SEO helps your content match those
            criteria.
